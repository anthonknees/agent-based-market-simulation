# agent-based-market-simulation


This project simulates a simplified electronic market with a centralized limit order book and multiple autonomous trader agents using different strategies.

## Features (Planned for Milestone 2)
- Single-asset market with limit order book
- Agent-based traders (random, momentum, mean reversion)
- Stochastic order arrivals and order sizes
- Metrics: price series, volatility, bid-ask spread, volume, and P&L by strategy
